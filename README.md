# Sales Data Analysis in SQL

In this project, I analyzed sales data using MySQL Workbench and Tableau Desktop to uncover valuable insights. Starting with the MySQL database, I extracted important details such as product sales and revenue trends. Through SQL queries, I grouped sales by product line and year, identifying top-selling products and monitoring revenue changes. Shifting to Tableau Desktop, I created visualizations like dynamic dashboards, presenting sales trends, product performance, and revenue distribution in an easy-to-understand format. By combining SQL analysis with Tableau visualization, I transformed raw sales data into actionable insights.
